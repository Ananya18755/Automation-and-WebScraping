Install the official Firefox Beta PPA
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:mozillateam/firefox-next
(this will add the file /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mozillateam-firefox-next-trusty.list and also fetch the PPAâ€™s key, which enables your Ubuntu system to verify that the packages in the PPA have not been interfered with since they were built)
Run apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get update
Install firefox and xvfb (the X windows virtual framebuffer) packages
$ sudo apt-get install firefox xvfb
Run Xvfb in the background and specify a display number (10 in my example)
$ Xvfb :10 -ac &
Set the DISPLAY variable to the number you chose
$ export DISPLAY=:10
Test that you can run firefox in the foreground with no errors
$ firefox
